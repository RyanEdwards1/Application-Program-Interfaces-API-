### What is a API

An API or an Application programming interface is a list of operation that developers can use within projects to give them help and do some of the heavy lifting. Simply a API allows the developer to save time by using a API to do the long winded work that others have already done for you all the developer needs to do is put in the credentials and the API will do the rest. 

Windows has a set of APIs that you can use in order to work with the user interface. There's no need to completely rebuild forms, commands, or even scroll bars. All of these actions are accessible within various APIs, and can be brought into your program

### What is a SDK

An SDK is a Software Development Kit. It is a collection of software used to develop applications for certain devices. SDKs usually include an integrated development environment. This serves as the central programming interface. The IDEs include a big range of applications for writing source code, debugging and a visual editor to create graphical user interface. These are all benefits for the developer to use so that he can do all of these things in one place.

An SDK can take the form of a simple one or more API in the form of libraries to a particular programming language.    

### The relationship between a API and SDK

The difference between a API and a SDK is. Firstly, a API is an interface that allows software programs to interact with each other. Whereas with a SDK is a set of tools that can be used to develop software applications targeting a specific platform. The simplest version of a SDK could be an API that contains some files required to interact with a specific programming language. When using an API, it can save a lot of coding and memory space when developing. While the SDK will still have the extra tools that you may never use but have to be stored within the SDK for example all of the library’s that have code stored within them but may never be used as the user has no need for them  

### Different range of APIs
Open AL API – Open AL is a cross-platform audio application programming interface.
Google Maps API – The Google Maps API for Flash provides a new way to add interactive Google Maps to your website, using Adobe's Flash plugin to display dynamic map content
YouTube API –  This API allows users to integrate their program with YouTube and allow it to perform many of the operations available on the website. It provides the capability to search for videos, retrieve standard feeds, and see related content

### Security of API

Security measures are one of the most important aspects of building an application programming interface. As Users will be downloading them directly onto their PCs. It’s great for an API to connect systems and give developers access to the data and functions they need to create new apps and digital experiences, but only if those connections and that access are protected otherwise you could end up downloading something dangerous onto your PC.

One of the main security processes of a API is if it has authentication or not from different organisations. This will provide reassurance to the person downloading the API as they can see that it is a safe piece of software and can will not have any dangerous or malicious code stored inside.

Another is encrypting the data. As hacking and hijacking becomes more popular within computing and businesses. When transferring or downloading data it can benefit if it is encrypted as if it was to get in the wrong hands then they do not get any information. APIs can be used to do this as well to help the user encrypted their own data APIs play an important role in this process. To go beyond the basic encryption and protections provided by TLS and authentication mechanisms, API providers should employ trace tools for debugging issues.

Finally, there is many different ways to keep your APIs safe and be able to tell if a API is safe to download. Firstly, if the API is massively complex and full up of unneeded things then it could contain something dangerous. So one key is to keep the API simple only include needed data. Secondly keep your passwords protected don’t share them with anyone and use effective symbols and capital letters within your password.
