### What is a API

An API or an Application programming interface is a list of operation that developers can use within projects to give them help and do some of the heavy lifting. Simply a API allows the developer to save time by using a API to do the long winded work that others have already done for you all the developer needs to do is put in the credentials and the API will do the rest. 
Windows has a set of APIs that you can use in order to work with the user interface. There's no need to completely rebuild forms, commands, or even scroll bars. All of these actions are accessible within various APIs, and can be brought into your program

### What is a SDK

An SDK is a Software Development Kit. It is a collection of software used to develop applications for certain devices. SDKs usually include an integrated development environment. This serves as the central programming interface. The IDEs include a big range of applications for writing source code, debugging and a visual editor to create graphical user interface. These are all benefits for the developer to use so that he can do all of these things in one place.
An SDK can take the form of a simple one or more API in the form of libraries to a particular programming language.    

### The relationship between a API and SDK

The difference between a API and a SDK is. Firstly, a API is an interface that allows software programs to interact with each other. Whereas with a SDK is a set of tools that can be used to develop software applications targeting a specific platform. The simplest version of a SDK could be an API that contains some files required to interact with a specific programming language. When using an API, it can save a lot of coding and memory space when developing. While the SDK will still have the extra tools that you may never use but have to be stored within the SDK taking up room in the program
